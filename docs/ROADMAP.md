# SONAR Protocol Roadmap

**Building the future of decentralized audio datasets, from hackathon MVP to global creator network**

---

## Overview

SONAR Protocol is developing a comprehensive ecosystem for decentralized audio dataset storage, verification, and marketplace. Our roadmap is structured in three phases, each building upon the previous to create a robust, scalable, and community-driven platform.

- Redundant storage across multiple nodes
- CDN-like delivery for audio streaming

#### SEAL Encryption
- End-to-end encryption using Mysten SEAL
- Access control via blockchain policies
- Encrypted data remains private until purchase
- Key distribution through on-chain verification

#### Audio Verification System
- Pre-encryption quality checks
- Audio format validation (MP3, WAV, FLAC)
- Duration and bitrate verification
- Metadata extraction and validation

#### Spam Prevention
- **1 SUI upload fee** to deter spam submissions
- Economic incentive for quality over quantity
- Prevents network abuse and low-quality content
- Funds protocol treasury for development

- Revenue forecasting and insights
- Batch upload tools for large datasets

#### Community Voting & Curation
- Community-driven quality assessment
- Upvote/downvote system for datasets
- Reputation system for creators
- Featured datasets and trending sections
- Curator rewards for high-quality curation

#### Enhanced Storage Lease Management
- Flexible storage durations (30/90/180/365 days)
- Automatic renewal options
- Storage lease marketplace (transfer leases)
- Expiration notifications
- Archive tier for long-term storage

## Phase 3: FUTURE (Scale & Decentralize) 🚀

**Status:** Vision
**Timeline:** 12+ months
**Focus:** Token launch, governance, cross-chain expansion, and global scale

### Major Milestones

#### SNR Token Launch
- **Launch:** Token launch coming soon (exploring launch options)
- **Token Utility:**
  - Payment for datasets
  - Staking for governance rights

#### DAO Governance
- **On-Chain Voting:** Token-weighted governance
- **Protocol Parameters:** Community control over fees, thresholds, policies
- **Treasury Management:** DAO-controlled treasury for grants and development
- **Proposal System:** Anyone can propose protocol improvements
- **Quadratic Voting:** Prevent plutocracy, give voice to smaller holders

#### Cross-Chain Expansion
- **Ethereum:** Bridge SNR token to Ethereum L1
- **Polygon:** Low-cost transactions for microtransactions
- **Solana:** High-throughput marketplace integration
- **Multi-Chain Storage:** Unified datasets across chains
- **Interoperability:** Cross-chain purchase and access

#### Enterprise Partnerships

# Purchasing Datasets

SONAR is not just for creators. Buyers can browse, preview, and purchase high-quality verified audio datasets for AI training, research, sound design, and more.

## How Purchasing Works

The process is straightforward:

1. **Browse**: Explore datasets by subject, quality, or popularity
2. **Preview**: Listen to the first 30 seconds for free
3. **Review**: Read the full description and quality scores
4. **Purchase**: Pay with SUI or SNR tokens
5. **Download**: Decrypt and access the full audio

Each purchase is secure, fair, and transparent.

## Pricing

Creators set their own prices based on rarity, quality, and dataset size. High-rarity, verified datasets typically command premium prices compared to common datasets.

## What You Get

When you purchase a dataset, you receive:

**Full-Quality Audio**: Complete, uncompressed audio at original quality
**Full Duration**: Entire recording(s), not just preview
**Metadata**: Complete information about the recording
**Permanent Access**: Can download and re-download anytime
**Commercial Rights**: Subject to creator's license terms
**No DRM**: Downloaded files are completely yours

## Payment Methods

To purchase, you can use either **SUI** or **SNR tokens**:

**Paying with SUI**:
- Available now for early-stage purchases
- Direct payment from your Sui wallet
- Temporary support (will transition to SNR-only in future)

**Paying with SNR**:
- Coming soon with full liquidity
- SONAR's native token with full tokenomics
- Long-term payment method

**Getting SNR**:
- Upload datasets and earn points (redeemable for SNR in future airdrop)
- Receive from selling your datasets
- Participate in airdrops and bounties
- Earn from contributions to platform

**Payment**: Purchase price deducted directly from your wallet

## What Happens to Your Money

When you purchase a dataset:

- **60%**: Goes to the creator (vested over 30 days)
- **40%**: Goes to the protocol for operations and maintenance

Creator receives the full 60% share, which vests daily over 30 days.

## Privacy and Security

Your purchases are:

**Blockchain-Recorded**: Permanent record of your purchase ownership
**Decentralized**: No central authority controls your access
**Encrypted**: Audio remains encrypted until you authorize decryption
**Your Data**: Creators cannot revoke access or track how you use audio

Creator knows you purchased but cannot see how you use the audio.

## Usage Rights

When you purchase, you typically receive:

**Personal Use**: Use for personal projects, research, study
**Commercial Use**: Subject to creator's license (check terms)
**AI Training**: Most datasets are licensed for AI training
**Modification**: Allowed for most creative/research uses
**Resale**: Generally NOT allowed (protects creator earnings)

Check the creator's license terms in each dataset's description.

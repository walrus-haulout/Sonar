# Token Economics

SNR token economics are designed to be sustainable and prevent the death spiral that kills most crypto projects. **Early alpha users are earning points now for a future SNR airdrop** — as you upload datasets and participate in the marketplace, you accumulate points that will be redeemable for SNR tokens when token trading launches.

## The Problem SONAR Solves

Most crypto projects use fixed token burn rates. As the project grows:

1. Burn rate stays constant
2. Token supply shrinks constantly
3. Prices need to climb to justify economics
4. When price drops (inevitable volatility), burn rate becomes untenable
5. Project dies or shifts models

SONAR uses adaptive tokenomics that respond to market conditions.

## Adaptive Burns

SNR adjusts burn rates automatically based on circulating supply:

**Over 50 Million SNR**:
- 20% burned on each purchase
- 50% to creator
- 30% to operations

**35-50 Million SNR**:
- 15% burned on each purchase
- 60% to creator
- 25% to operations

**20-35 Million SNR**:
- 10% burned on each purchase
- 65% to creator
- 25% to operations

**Under 20 Million SNR**:
- 0% burned on each purchase (no burn)
- 80% to creator
- 20% to operations

As supply shrinks, burn slows and creator rewards increase. This prevents the death spiral.

## Creator Rewards

### Initial Allocation

When you publish a dataset, you receive an initial allocation based on rarity and quality:

**Low Rarity, Low Quality**: Low points allocation
**Medium Rarity, Good Quality**: Medium points allocation
**High Rarity, Excellent Quality**: High points allocation
**Critical Rarity, Best Quality**: Highest points allocation

Vesting: Unlocked over 90 days (claimable starting day 30)

### Purchase Revenue

When someone purchases your dataset:

- 50-80% goes to you (depending on supply levels)
- Vesting: Unlocked daily over 30 days

Example: For any dataset purchase:
- Creator receives majority share (50-80% depending on supply levels)
- Platform receives a portion (0-30% variable)
- Remainder is burned (variable)

## Platform Treasury

The platform (SONAR DAO) receives:

- Purchase splits (20-30% depending on supply)
- Submission fees (0.001% of supply, burned)
- Developer grants
- Community programs

Treasury funds:
- Server operations
- Development and improvements
- Marketing and adoption
- Community programs
- DAO governance

## Burn Mechanics

Token burns serve multiple purposes:

**Deflationary**: Shrinking supply increases value per token
**Anti-Spam**: Submission fee (burned) prevents spam uploads
**Market Health**: Prevents oversaturation of tokens

Submission fee of 0.001% of circulating supply. Fee adjusts with supply to maintain relative cost.

## Vesting Schedules

### Initial Allocation Vesting

90-day vesting for initial dataset rewards:

**Day 1-29**: Locked (cannot claim)
**Day 30**: ~33% claimable
**Day 60**: ~67% claimable
**Day 90**: 100% claimable

You can claim at any time during vesting.

### Purchase Revenue Vesting

30-day vesting for purchase revenue:

**Day 1-9**: Locked
**Day 10**: ~33% claimable
**Day 30**: 100% claimable

Daily vesting during this period.

Vesting ensures stable, predictable token release.

## Airdrop Distribution

Periodic airdrops reward active creators:

**Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly (community voted)
**Eligibility**: Based on contributions and participation
**Allocation**: Weighted by 5 factors (see Airdrop section)
**Distribution**: Direct to wallet, immediately available

Airdrops are separate from rewards and vesting.

## Supply Dynamics

### Token Supply Changes

**Increase**:
- Creator rewards (up to 80% of purchases)
- Airdrop distributions
- Founder/team allocation (fixed)

**Decrease**:
- Burn on purchases (0-20% depending on supply)
- Submission fees (burned)
- Developer programs (if burn > awards)

The system targets equilibrium: supply growth = burn + usage.

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Rapid Growth**
- Many new creators earning points
- Many purchases happening
- Supply growing faster than burn
- Adaptive burns increase to 20% to slow growth

**Scenario 2: Market Plateau**
- Fewer new creators
- Stable purchase volume
- Supply stabilizing
- Adaptive burns reduce to 10% to increase creator rewards

**Scenario 3: Market Decline**
- Fewer users and purchases
- Supply threatening to overinflate
- Adaptive burns reduce to 0%
- Creator rewards increase to 80% to encourage participation

## Token Utility

SNR tokens are used for:

**Purchasing**: Buy audio datasets on marketplace
**Staking**: Stake for governance rights (future)
**Fees**: Pay submission fees
**Rewards**: Earn by creating and participating

Token value grows with:
- Adoption (more purchases)
- Scarcity (burn > creation)
- Utility (needed for marketplace)
- Community (governance participation)

## Preventing Price Manipulation

**Anti-Whale Measures**:
- Vesting schedules prevent dumping
- Adaptive burns prevent over-minting
- DAO governance prevents sudden changes
- Community oversight of tokenomics

## Treasury Management

The SONAR DAO controls treasury spending:

**Operations**: 40-50% (servers, development)
**Community**: 20-30% (bounties, programs)
**Future**: 20-30% (strategic reserves)

Treasury is transparent and community-governed.

## Key Takeaway

SONAR's tokenomics are designed for sustainability. By adapting burn rates to market conditions and rewarding creators fairly, SONAR avoids the death spirals that kill most crypto projects.

The system incentivizes creators to contribute quality content, incentivizes buyers to purchase datasets, and maintains token value through scarcity and utility.

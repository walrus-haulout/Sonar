# Token Economics

SNR token economics are designed to be sustainable and prevent the death spiral that kills most crypto projects. **Early alpha users are earning points now for a future SNR airdrop** — as you upload datasets and participate in the marketplace, you accumulate points that will be redeemable for SNR tokens when token trading launches.

## The Problem SONAR Solves

Most crypto projects use fixed token burn rates. As the project grows:

1. Burn rate stays constant
2. Token supply shrinks constantly
3. Prices need to climb to justify economics
4. When price drops (inevitable volatility), burn rate becomes untenable
5. Project dies or shifts models

SONAR uses adaptive tokenomics that respond to market conditions.

## Purchase Revenue Split

When creators receive revenue from dataset purchases, the split is straightforward:

**60%** goes to the creator
**40%** goes to the protocol for operations and maintenance

This simple split ensures creators earn fairly while the protocol remains sustainable.

## Creator Rewards

### Initial Allocation

When you publish a dataset, you receive an initial allocation based on rarity and quality:

**Low Rarity, Low Quality**: Low points allocation
**Medium Rarity, Good Quality**: Medium points allocation
**High Rarity, Excellent Quality**: High points allocation
**Critical Rarity, Best Quality**: Highest points allocation

Vesting: Unlocked over 90 days (claimable starting day 30)

### Purchase Revenue

When someone purchases your dataset, you receive 60% of the purchase price. Payment is vested over 30 days and unlocked daily.

## Platform Treasury

The platform receives 40% of purchase revenue to fund:
- Server operations
- Development and improvements
- Community programs
- Protocol governance

The 0.25 SUI upload fee helps prevent spam submissions.

## Vesting Schedules

### Initial Allocation Vesting

90-day vesting for initial dataset rewards:

**Day 1-29**: Locked (cannot claim)
**Day 30**: ~33% claimable
**Day 60**: ~67% claimable
**Day 90**: 100% claimable

You can claim at any time during vesting.

### Purchase Revenue Vesting

30-day vesting for purchase revenue:

**Day 1-9**: Locked
**Day 10**: ~33% claimable
**Day 30**: 100% claimable

Daily vesting during this period.

Vesting ensures stable, predictable token release.

## Airdrop Distribution

Periodic airdrops reward active creators:

**Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly (community voted)
**Eligibility**: Based on contributions and participation
**Allocation**: Weighted by 5 factors (see Airdrop section)
**Distribution**: Direct to wallet, immediately available

Airdrops are separate from rewards and vesting.

## Supply Dynamics

### Token Supply Changes

**Increase**:
- Creator rewards (up to 80% of purchases)
- Airdrop distributions
- Founder/team allocation (fixed)

**Decrease**:
- Burn on purchases (0-20% depending on supply)
- Submission fees (burned)
- Developer programs (if burn > awards)

The system targets equilibrium: supply growth = burn + usage.

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Rapid Growth**
- Many new creators earning points
- Many purchases happening
- Supply growing faster than burn
- Adaptive burns increase to 20% to slow growth

**Scenario 2: Market Plateau**
- Fewer new creators
- Stable purchase volume
- Supply stabilizing
- Adaptive burns reduce to 10% to increase creator rewards

**Scenario 3: Market Decline**
- Fewer users and purchases
- Supply threatening to overinflate
- Adaptive burns reduce to 0%
- Creator rewards increase to 80% to encourage participation

## Token Utility

SNR tokens are used for:

**Purchasing**: Buy audio datasets on marketplace
**Staking**: Stake for governance rights (future)
**Fees**: Pay submission fees
**Rewards**: Earn by creating and participating

Token value grows with:
- Adoption (more purchases)
- Scarcity (burn > creation)
- Utility (needed for marketplace)
- Community (governance participation)

## Preventing Price Manipulation

**Anti-Whale Measures**:
- Vesting schedules prevent dumping
- Adaptive burns prevent over-minting
- DAO governance prevents sudden changes
- Community oversight of tokenomics

## Treasury Management

The SONAR DAO controls treasury spending:

**Operations**: 40-50% (servers, development)
**Community**: 20-30% (bounties, programs)
**Future**: 20-30% (strategic reserves)

Treasury is transparent and community-governed.

## Key Takeaway

SONAR's tokenomics are designed for sustainability. With a simple, transparent 60/40 revenue split between creators and the protocol, SONAR ensures both creators and the platform can thrive long-term.

The system incentivizes creators to contribute quality content, incentivizes buyers to purchase datasets, and maintains token value through scarcity and utility.

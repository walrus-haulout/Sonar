# Revenue Splits and Economics

SONAR uses a simple, transparent revenue split model:

## Creator Revenue: 60% / Protocol: 40%

When a dataset is purchased, the revenue is divided as follows:

- **60%** goes to the creator
- **40%** goes to the protocol for operations, development, and community programs

This fixed split is:
- **Predictable**: Creators know exactly what they'll earn
- **Fair**: Creators keep the majority of revenue
- **Sustainable**: The protocol receives stable funding for ongoing development
- **Simple**: No complex tiers or variable calculations

## Upload Fee

To prevent spam submissions, there is a fixed **0.25 SUI** upload fee that all creators pay when publishing a dataset.

## Vesting

Creator revenue from purchases vests daily over 30 days, ensuring smooth cash flow while preventing market manipulation from sudden large withdrawals.

## Why This Model Works

The simplicity of this model allows creators to plan their earnings confidently while the protocol can rely on stable revenue for long-term sustainability. This is far more sustainable than complex tier-based burn models that become difficult to maintain and explain over time.

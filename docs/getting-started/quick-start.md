## Step 3: Add Metadata (2 minutes)

Provide information about your audio:

**Title**: A clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Northern Cardinal Calls, Eastern USA")

**Description**: What is this audio? What makes it special? Be specific. (e.g., "High-quality recordings of Northern Cardinal territorial and alarm calls recorded in natural woodland habitat in the Eastern United States. Multiple individuals and call types included.")

**Languages**: Which languages are spoken or implied?

5. Click "Next"

## Step 5: Verify (2-3 minutes, automatic)

SONAR now analyzes your audio automatically. This includes:

## Tips for Higher Scores

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "dog barking," say "Golden Retriever barking during play, outdoor environment"
2. **Focus on Rarity**: Rare sounds get 3-5x multipliers. Endangered species, vintage equipment, uncommon accents
3. **High Quality**: Use good recording equipment. High sample rate (48kHz or better) adds points
4. **Bulk Contributions**: Submitting 100+ samples of one subject gives a 2x multiplier the first time
5. **First to Market**: Be the first to submit a subject for bonuses
6. **Complete Metadata**: Full, accurate descriptions help AI verify and score your audio

## Troubleshooting

**Upload Failed?**
- Check file format (MP3, WAV, M4A)
- Ensure file size under limit
- Try a different browser

**Verification Failed?**
- Audio too short (minimum 1 second)
- Audio too quiet (adjust volume levels)
- Copyrighted content detected
- Safety violations (hate speech, violence)

**Can't See Leaderboard Update?**
- Blockchain confirmation takes 10-20 seconds
- Check your wallet address matches
- Refresh the page

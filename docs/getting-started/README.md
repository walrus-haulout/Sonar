# Getting Started with SONAR

SONAR is a decentralized marketplace for audio datasets. We help you upload, verify, monetize, and purchase high-quality audio data with full privacy and transparency.

## What Makes SONAR Different?

**Your Privacy is Guaranteed**: Audio is encrypted on your computer before uploading. We never see unencrypted audio except during verification, and only with your explicit authorization. Even our servers cannot decrypt your data without permission.

**Intelligence First**: We use AI to analyze audio quality, detect copyright issues, transcribe speech, and verify safety. Low-quality or problematic audio is blocked before reaching the marketplace.

**Fair Economics**: Unlike centralized platforms that take large cuts, SONAR uses smart contracts for transparent revenue distribution. Creators, buyers, and the ecosystem all benefit fairly.

**Competitive Leaderboards**: Every upload is scored on rarity, specificity, and quality. Climb the leaderboard from Contributor to Legend tier and unlock achievements along the way.

**Decentralized Storage**: Your encrypted audio lives on Walrus, a decentralized storage network. No company can shut down your data or revoke access arbitrarily.

## The Core Idea

Audio has tremendous value for AI training and research. But most creators are exploited by centralized platforms that pay unfairly. SONAR inverts this: creators are rewarded handsomely for rare, high-quality audio, and buyers know exactly what they are purchasing.

## How It Works (60 Second Summary)

1. **Upload**: You select audio files and provide metadata (title, description, languages, tags)
2. **Encrypt**: Your browser encrypts the audio using client-side encryption. No unencrypted file ever leaves your device
3. **Verify**: SONAR's AI analyzes the audio for quality, copyright, transcription, and safety
4. **Publish**: Your dataset is registered on the Sui blockchain with the encrypted audio reference
5. **Earn**: You receive SONAR tokens based on how rare and high-quality your audio is
6. **Compete**: Your score updates the global leaderboard, and you unlock achievements
7. **Monetize**: Buyers can purchase access to your dataset and listen securely

## Common Questions

**Q: Is my audio really private?**
Yes. Encryption happens on your computer before upload. We never see your plaintext audio except during AI verification, which requires your authorization. Even SONAR servers cannot decrypt your data without your permission.

**Q: Why do I need to connect my wallet?**
Your wallet proves you own the audio dataset. It is also how you receive SONAR token rewards and purchase other datasets. You control your earnings completely.

**Q: What if my audio is copied?**
During verification, we check against copyrighted works. If high-quality matches are found, the upload is rejected before reaching the marketplace. Additionally, the blockchain records your ownership timestamp, proving you published first.

**Q: How much can I earn?**
Earnings depend on your audio's rarity tier, quality, specificity, and bulk size. A high-rarity, high-quality submission can earn anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of SONAR tokens. Leaderboard leaders earn significantly more per submission.

**Q: What makes audio rare?**
Rarity depends on several factors: subject rarity (endangered species vs common birds), specificity (detailed variants vs generic), saturation (how many similar submissions exist), and quality. Our AI researches each subject to determine true rarity.

**Q: Can I sell my purchased datasets?**
No. When you buy a dataset, you receive personal access to decrypt and use it. You cannot resell or redistribute it. This protects creators' earnings.

**Q: Is SONAR really decentralized?**
Yes. Audio is stored on Walrus (decentralized), encryption keys are managed by Mysten SEAL (threshold cryptography across multiple servers), and smart contracts on Sui handle rewards and purchases. No single entity controls the platform.

# Uploading Audio to SONAR

This guide walks you through the complete process of uploading audio datasets to SONAR, from file selection through blockchain publication.

## Overview

The upload process happens in six sequential steps:

1. **File Selection** - Choose your audio files
2. **Metadata** - Describe what your audio is about
3. **Encryption** - Your browser encrypts the audio locally
4. **Verification** - AI analyzes quality, copyright, safety, and transcription
5. **Publishing** - Register on the blockchain and receive tokens
6. **Earning** - Your dataset appears on the marketplace and leaderboard

Each step is designed to be intuitive while maintaining the highest privacy and security standards.

## Key Principles

**Privacy First**: Your audio never exists unencrypted outside your browser except during AI verification with your explicit authorization. We never store your plaintext audio.

**Quality Assured**: Every upload is analyzed automatically to ensure it meets marketplace standards. Low-quality, copyrighted, or unsafe content is blocked before reaching buyers.

**Fair Rewards**: You earn tokens based on your audio's rarity, quality, and specificity. The better your dataset, the more you earn.

**Transparent Process**: You can see exactly what is happening at each step. Verification progress is shown in real time.

## Requirements

Before uploading, you need:

**Audio File**: Supported formats are MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, or FLAC
- Minimum duration: 1 second
- Maximum duration: 1 hour per file
- File size limit: 500 MB per file

**Wallet**: A Sui-compatible wallet to authenticate and receive rewards

**Metadata**: Basic information about your audio
- Title (required)
- Description (required)
- Languages (optional)
- Tags (optional)

**Time**: The entire process takes 5-10 minutes depending on audio length

- **[Step 4: Verification](verification.md)** - AI analysis in progress
- **[Step 5: Publishing](publishing.md)** - Register and earn tokens

## Tips for Success

### Quality Matters

High-quality audio earns more points. Before uploading:
- Use good recording equipment
- Ensure consistent volume levels
- Minimize background noise (unless it is intentional)
- Use high sample rates (48kHz or better is ideal)

### Be Specific

Generic descriptions earn fewer points. Instead of:
- "Dog sounds"

Say:
- "Golden Retriever barking during play, outdoor suburban setting, high-energy vocalizations, clear weather"

### Verify First Compliance

Avoid rejected uploads by ensuring:
- You own the copyright to the audio
- It is not a direct copy of existing recordings
- It complies with safety guidelines (no hate speech, graphic violence)
- It is not extremely low quality (too quiet, too much noise)

### Plan Your Bulk

If you have 100+ samples of one subject, upload them together:
- First bulk submission gets 2x multiplier
- Bulk submissions provide comprehensive data
- Subsequent bulk submissions of same subject get 1.2x

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upload the same audio multiple times?**
No. Duplicate uploads are detected during verification and rejected.

**Q: What if verification fails?**
You will see the specific reason (copyright, quality, safety, etc.). You can try uploading a different version of the audio if you believe the rejection was incorrect.

**Q: How long does verification take?**
Typically 2-3 minutes, but can vary depending on audio length. Longer files take slightly longer.

**Q: Can I edit metadata after publishing?**
Title and description are permanent once published. Choose them carefully before publishing.

**Q: Do I need to re-upload if I made a mistake?**
Yes, you must unpublish the dataset and upload again. This costs additional transaction fees, so review everything before publishing.

**Q: Will my uploaded audio be heard by SONAR employees?**
During verification only, with your authorization. We decrypt temporarily to analyze, then discard the plaintext. We do not listen to or store your unencrypted audio.

## What Happens After Publishing?

Once your dataset is published:

**Immediately**: 
- Dataset appears in your profile
- Blockchain confirms ownership
- You receive initial token rewards
- Leaderboard position updates

**Within 1 hour**:
- Dataset appears in marketplace search
- Buyers can preview (first 30 seconds)
- Others can see your submission

**Over 1 week**:
- Similar submissions are identified
- Saturation level calculated
- Final rarity score and penalties applied
- Your leaderboard ranking stabilizes

**Over 1 month**:
- Buyers can purchase your full dataset
- You receive revenue from purchases
- Achievements unlock automatically

# Step 2: Metadata

Metadata describes what your audio is about. Quality metadata helps the AI analyze your audio correctly and helps buyers understand what they are purchasing. This step directly impacts your rarity score and points earned.

## Why Metadata Matters

Metadata affects your score in multiple ways:

**AI Analysis**: Better descriptions help the AI understand your audio and assign accurate rarity tiers

**Specificity Score**: Detailed metadata increases specificity grades (A, B, C, etc.)

**Searchability**: Clear tags help buyers find your dataset

**Verification**: Verification algorithms use metadata to cross-check your audio content

Spending extra time on metadata can increase your score by 10-20%.

## Title

Your title should be clear, specific, and searchable.

### Good Titles

Good titles are descriptive and specific:
- "Northern Cardinal Territorial Calls, Eastern USA, High Resolution"
- "1967 Mustang V8 Engine Startup Sequence"
- "Brooklyn Accent Native Speakers, Multi-Generational Interviews"
- "Footsteps on Different Floor Types, High-Quality Audio"

Bad titles are generic:
- "Bird sounds"
- "Car noises"
- "People talking"
- "Recording 001"

### Title Guidelines

- **Length**: 5-100 characters (10-50 words is typical)
- **Specificity**: Include location, species, equipment, dialect, etc.
- **Accuracy**: Describes the actual content
- **Searchable**: Uses terms buyers might search for
- **No Clickbait**: No misleading descriptions

### Title Examples by Category

**Animal Sounds**:
- "African Elephant Herd Calls and Rumbles, Natural Savanna Setting"
- "Southern Tree Frog Spring Chorus, Wetland Habitat, Louisiana"

**Human Sounds**:
- "New Zealand Accent Conversational Speech, Age 25-35, Native Speakers"
- "Professional Voice Acting Emotional Range, British RP Accent"
- "Genuine Sneezing, Coughing, Laughing Vocalizations, Multiple Speakers"

**Equipment/Mechanical**:
- "Vintage Rotary Phone Dialing and Ringing Sequences, 1960s-1980s"
- "Heavy Machinery Operating Sounds, Industrial Warehouse Setting"

**Music/Instruments**:
- "Acoustic Guitar Fingerpicking Techniques, Classical and Flamenco Styles"
- "Vintage Piano Forte Notes, Classical Concert Grand, Unprocessed"

**Ambient/Environmental**:
- "Forest Soundscape, Multiple Bird Species, Early Morning Chorus"
- "Urban Traffic Ambience, Busy Intersection, Rush Hour, High Quality"

## Description

Your description should explain in detail what the audio contains. This is the most important metadata field for your rarity score.

### Good Descriptions

Detailed descriptions help AI assign correct rarity tiers and specificity grades:

"High-quality recordings of Northern Cardinal territorial and alarm calls collected in natural woodland habitat across Eastern United States. Multiple individuals recorded. Includes boundary defense calls, mating calls, and predator alarm vocalizations. Recorded with professional microphone in morning and evening hours. Minimal wind noise. Includes 47 individual recordings of different cardinal individuals across 12 locations. Stereo, 48kHz, 16-bit. No post-processing beyond normalization. Complete dataset of cardinal vocalizations for AI training on songbird communication."

### Bad Descriptions

Generic descriptions earn lower scores:

"Bird sounds. Different types. Good quality audio. Recorded outdoors."

### Description Examples

**Animal Sounds**:

"Complete audio collection of Javan Hawk-Eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) vocalizations recorded in Gunung Halimun-Salak National Park, Java, Indonesia between March-September 2023. This critically endangered species is extremely difficult to record in the wild. Includes territorial pair calls, alarm calls, nestling begging calls, and food-associated vocalizations. 156 individual recording samples spanning 23 hours of audio total. Recorded with Sony PCM-D100 portable recorder and Sennheiser directional microphone. 96kHz, 24-bit stereo. Minimal post-processing: only DC offset removal and peak normalization applied. Raw recordings preserved to maintain natural acoustic characteristics. Comprehensive documentation of all recording locations, dates, and behavioral context included. No known complete dataset of this species' vocalizations exists in open audio repositories."

**Human Speech**:

"Multi-generational Brooklyn-accent English speakers engaged in natural conversational dialogue on various topics (food, sports, weather, travel). Participants are native Brooklyn-born speakers aged 18-78 with lifetime residence in the borough. Accents range from moderate to strong Brooklyn characteristics. 48 speakers total, 67 hours of unscripted natural conversation. Recorded in quiet indoor environments with Shure SM7B microphone at 48kHz, 24-bit. Minimal processing: DC offset removal and peak normalization only. No temporal editing. Speakers signed consent forms. Comprehensive speaker metadata included: age, neighborhood, generation, occupation. Rare resource for studying sustained regional accent variations and intergenerational linguistic change. No similar dataset available for Brooklyn accent research."

**Equipment Sounds**:

"Extensive audio library of vintage telephone equipment sound effects from the 1960s-1990s. Includes rotary phone dialing (10 different models), bell ringing (8 variants), handset clicks, receiver cradle sounds, off-hook tones, busy signal tones, dial tone, and phone line artifacts. 327 individual samples totaling 8.2 hours. Recorded using Neumann U87 condenser microphone into Universal Audio Apollo interface at 96kHz, 24-bit. Each sound captured from actual vintage equipment in working condition. Multiple takes per effect to capture natural variations. Minimal processing: only level matching and peak normalization. Documented by specific phone model and manufacturer. Unique dataset for period-accurate sound design in media production. No other comprehensive vintage telephone audio library publicly available."

# SONAR Documentation

Welcome to SONAR (Sound Oracle Network for Audio Rewards), a decentralized marketplace for high-quality audio datasets built on the Sui blockchain.

## What is SONAR?

SONAR is a platform that lets you upload audio datasets and earn points based on AI-verified quality (redeemable for SNR tokens in a future airdrop), while competing in a global leaderboard. It combines privacy-preserving encryption, decentralized storage, and intelligent AI verification to create a sustainable audio data economy.

Whether you are creating audio datasets for AI training, researching sound patterns, or looking to build a diverse audio collection, SONAR provides the tools and incentives you need.

## For Creators

Upload your audio datasets and earn points toward a future SNR airdrop. The system automatically analyzes your audio for quality, copyright, safety, and rarity. The higher the rarity score, the more points you earn. Participate in a leaderboard, unlock achievements, and become eligible for periodic airdrops.

## For Buyers

Browse verified audio datasets, listen to previews, and purchase the datasets you need for your projects. Every purchase is secure with threshold-encrypted audio and decentralized storage.

## Key Features

**Privacy First**: Your audio is encrypted client-side before ever leaving your device. Only with your authorization can anyone decrypt it.

**Quality Verified**: Every upload goes through six stages of AI analysis including quality checks, copyright detection, transcription, and safety screening.

**Fair Rewards**: Earn points based on your audio's rarity, specificity, quality, and bulk contributions. The leaderboard tracks your progress and achievements.

**Decentralized Storage**: Your encrypted audio lives on Walrus, a decentralized storage network. No single company controls your data.

**Transparent Tokenomics**: SONAR uses adaptive token economics that adjust to market conditions, preventing the death spiral that kills most crypto projects.

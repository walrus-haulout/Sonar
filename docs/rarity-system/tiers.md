## How Tiers Affect Airdrop

Your tier is a multiplier on your base airdrop score. Higher tiers receive larger multipliers, so your airdrop allocation increases as you accumulate more points and advance through the tiers. Advancing to higher tiers significantly increases your airdrop eligibility.

Higher tiers compound both higher points AND higher multipliers.

## Maintaining Your Tier

Your tier is based on all-time points. You never lose tier status for inactivity, but:

- Not submitting means lower future airdrop eligibility
- Tier depends on cumulative points (permanent once earned)
- Leaderboard rank updates based on recent activity
- Top tiers have expectations for community engagement

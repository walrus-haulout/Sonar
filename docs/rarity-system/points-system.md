# The Points System

Your points are the currency of SONAR's leaderboard. They determine your tier, rank, airdrop eligibility, and recognition in the community.

## The Formula

Points = Rarity Score × Six Multipliers

Points = Rarity × Quality × Bulk × Subject Rarity × Specificity × Verification × Early Contributor

Each multiplier ranges from 1.0 to a higher value. They multiply together, creating exponential rewards for submissions that excel in multiple dimensions.

## The Six Multipliers Explained

### 1. Quality Multiplier (1.0x to 1.5x)

Based on technical audio quality.

**1.5x** (Excellent): Sample rate 96kHz+, 24-bit, optimal volume (-12 to -3dB), no clipping, minimal noise
**1.3x** (Good): Sample rate 48kHz, 24-bit, good volume levels
**1.15x** (Decent): Sample rate 44.1kHz, 16-bit, acceptable volume
**1.05x** (Acceptable): Sample rate 16kHz, 8-bit, but meets minimums
**1.0x** (Poor): Below acceptable thresholds

**Example Impact**:
- Rarity 70: Low quality (1.0x) = 70 points vs. Excellent quality (1.5x) = 105 points
- 50% more points just for better recording equipment

### 2. Bulk Multiplier (1.0x to 2.0x)

Based on submitting multiple samples at once.

**2.0x** (First Bulk): You submit 100+ samples AND you are first to bulk-submit this subject
- Highest bonus because you are pioneering comprehensive data
- Example: First 150 audio samples of Javan Hawk-Eagle = 2.0x

**1.2x** (Subsequent Bulk): You submit 50+ samples but someone else already bulk-submitted this subject
- Bonus for contributing volume, but lower than first
- Example: Second 120 Cardinal samples = 1.2x

**1.0x** (Single): Fewer than 100 samples
- No bonus; standard submission

**Example Impact**:
- 50 rarity + first bulk (2.0x) = 100 points
- 50 rarity + subsequent (1.2x) = 60 points
- 50 rarity + single (1.0x) = 50 points

### 3. Subject Rarity Multiplier (0.5x to 5.0x)

This is the biggest multiplier. Based on how rare the subject is.

**5.0x** (Critical): Endangered species, extinct sounds, unique cultural audio
**3.0x** (High): Rare species, vintage equipment, uncommon dialects
**2.0x** (Medium): Some recordings exist, regional variants
**1.0x** (Standard): Common subjects, widely available
**0.5x** (Oversaturated): Extremely common, hundreds of recordings

**Example Impact**:
- Generic dog barking (0.5x): 70 × 0.5 = 35 points
- Critical endangered bird (5.0x): 70 × 5.0 = 350 points
- 10x difference based on subject rarity alone

### 4. Specificity Multiplier (1.0x to 1.3x)

Based on Grade A-F specificity of your description.

**1.3x** (Grade A): Highly detailed, specific variants, scientific names, locations, context
**1.2x** (Grade B): Good detail, mostly specific
**1.1x** (Grade C): Adequate detail, somewhat specific
**1.05x** (Grade D): Generic with some specific elements
**1.0x** (Grades E-F): Very generic

**Grade A Example**:
"Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) territorial calls recorded in 47 different locations across Eastern USA woodland habitat, March-April 2024, morning recordings only, minimal wind noise, includes boundary defense calls, mating calls, and predator alarms, 48kHz stereo, professional Sennheiser microphone"

**Grade F Example**:
"Bird sounds"

**Example Impact**:
- Grade F (1.0x): 70 × 1.0 = 70 points
- Grade A (1.3x): 70 × 1.3 = 91 points
- 30% bonus for detailed descriptions

### 5. Verification Multiplier (1.0x to 1.2x)

Based on whether AI verified your claims.

**1.2x** (Verified): All factual claims in your description are verified by AI research
**1.1x** (Partially Verified): Some claims verified, some unverifiable
**1.0x** (Unverified): Claims cannot be verified or no verification attempted

**Example Claim**:
You claim "Javan Hawk-Eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) recordings"
- AI researches: Does this species exist? Yes
- AI researches: Is it endangered? Yes (Critically Endangered)
- AI researches: Would recordings be rare? Yes
- Result: Verified (1.2x)

**Example Impact**:
- Unverified (1.0x): 70 × 1.0 = 70 points
- Verified (1.2x): 70 × 1.2 = 84 points
- 20% bonus for verified claims

### 6. Early Contributor Multiplier (1.0x to 1.5x)

Bonus for submitting early in SONAR's growth.

**1.5x**: You are among the first 100 datasets ever published
**1.3x**: Datasets 101-500 published
**1.2x**: Datasets 501-1,000 published
**1.0x**: Datasets 1,001+ published

This bonus decays as the platform grows. Early participants are rewarded.

**Example Impact**:
- 500th dataset (1.3x): 70 × 1.3 = 91 points
- 50,000th dataset (1.0x): 70 × 1.0 = 70 points
- 30% less points for later participants (incentivizes early adoption)

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Generic Audio (Low Points)

**Submission**: Generic dog barking, 5 samples

**Scores**:
- Rarity Score: 30 (generic dog sounds are common)
- Quality: 1.0x (poor audio from phone microphone)
- Bulk: 1.0x (only 5 samples)
- Subject Rarity: 0.5x (oversaturated)
- Specificity: 1.0x ("dog sounds" - very generic)
- Verification: 1.0x (generic claims)
- Early Contributor: 1.0x (late to platform)

**Calculation**: 30 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.5 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = **15 points**

### Example 2: Good Quality Audio (Medium Points)

**Submission**: 15 Northern Cardinal samples with decent description

**Scores**:
- Rarity Score: 65 (some recordings exist, but good specificity)
- Quality: 1.3x (48kHz, 16-bit, good recording)
- Bulk: 1.0x (15 samples, not bulk)
- Subject Rarity: 2.0x (medium rarity - regional variants)
- Specificity: 1.1x (Grade C - adequate detail)
- Verification: 1.1x (partially verified claims)
- Early Contributor: 1.3x (500th dataset)

**Calculation**: 65 × 1.3 × 1.0 × 2.0 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.3 = **407 points**

### Example 3: Rare, High-Quality Bulk (High Points)

**Submission**: 150 Javan Hawk-Eagle samples, detailed description, professional recording, first bulk

**Scores**:
- Rarity Score: 92 (critically endangered, rare recordings, detailed description)
- Quality: 1.5x (96kHz, 24-bit, professional equipment)
- Bulk: 2.0x (150 samples, FIRST bulk for this subject)
- Subject Rarity: 5.0x (critically endangered)
- Specificity: 1.3x (Grade A - highly detailed)
- Verification: 1.2x (all claims verified)
- Early Contributor: 1.3x (one of early creators)

**Calculation**: 92 × 1.5 × 2.0 × 5.0 × 1.3 × 1.2 × 1.3 = **18,850 points**

### Comparison

- Generic audio: 15 points
- Good quality: 407 points
- Rare, high-quality: 18,850 points

The rare, high-quality submission earns **1,250x more points** than the generic audio.
